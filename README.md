# Web develpment website

We want to design a website using CSS and HTML for a web programming course. This website consists of 5 main sections: Grid - Header - Lectures - Related Books - Footer

## Grid
First, we need to design the overall structure of our page, which consists of 4 main sections.

## Header
In this section, you should design the header of your page. For the background of this part, we use a photo that is in the center of the page and covers the whole page and there is a white frame around it.

According to the picture above, in this part we have a text that is located in the center of the page and when the page is loaded, it comes to the middle of the page as an animation with a horizontal movement. Purchase of textbooks is displayed. This key also has an effect for when the mouse hovers over it.

## Lectures

In this section, we have to design 4 cards to display the information of 4 chapters of web programming lessons along with their logos. In this section, a colored aura is displayed on the background photo. <br>
The cards are semi-transparent and the text of each card is placed in the middle. <br>
Also, the displayed logos are semi-transparent and the borders of the cards are also rounded. <br>
Also, when the mouse comes over any of the information cards, we have designed an effect for that card, which shows that the mouse is placed on that card: the card becomes a little bigger and rises a little higher than its place.

## Related Books

In this section, we have a title that is placed above this section and in the middle, and we designed an effect for when the mouse hovers over it. <br> 
3 cards have been designed that display 3 books related to the web programming course along with their information, and when the mouse hovers over one of these cards, the card returns and the price of that book is displayed along with a key to buy it. It will be given. <br>
We designed this key in such a way that when you click on it, a popup page will appear on the screen as shown below, where you can see the cover photo of the book along with more information, and also a button for There is a purchase that takes the user to the Amazon site to buy books. <br>
All the buttons used in this section have the same effect as the header section. <br>

## Footer

Just as there is a header on the website pages, there should also be a footer that includes information such as the site designer and company contact information, etc. In this section, two columns are designed side by side, and in the right column, you can put information about the designer of this site. Each of the links mentioned has a back effect.

## Menu

<br>
In this section, we first designed the navigation menu icon so that when scrolling the page, this icon is always on the left side and at the top of the page. <br>
In this menu, we put the link of Header, Lectures, Related Books sections as shown above, and they have an effect when the mouse hovers over them. <br>

<br> And as the final task, in the tab section of the browser, we determined the name of the website along with the logo of the page displayed next to it, as in the image above.
